## dotfiles

This is my repo for my dotfiles. Primarily, zsh/(n)vim.

neovim reads the vim runtime dir, so global changes go there, otherwise
you can just change neovim's configuration.

TODO:
 * Find or write a python folding vim script that isn't super slow
 * Set up denite:
 * most recently used files
 * file browser
 * [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim) for other ideas
